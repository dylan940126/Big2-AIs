# Big 2 Server

Play Big 2 against agents trained with deep reinforcement project (see <a href="https://github.com/henrycharlesworth/big2_PPOalgorithm">this project</a> for more details). Rules can be found <a href="https://github.com/henrycharlesworth/big2_PPOalgorithm/blob/master/rules.md">here</a>.

Currently hosting an online version at: https://big2-rl-4ba753215e7b.herokuapp.com/

But if this ever goes down this should allow you to deploy and run the web-app locally. Tested using Python 3.8.5, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run `python manage.py runserver`.
